## Introduction  
Weeds pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity, causing yield losses and increasing the need for herbicides. Traditional weed detection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, making them inefficient for large-scale farming operations. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in various computer vision tasks, including object detection. This project aim to use deep learning models to detect weeds, compare their performance, and provide additional analysis using a newly created dataset
